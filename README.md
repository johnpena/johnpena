My name is John Pe√±a. I'm known for being one of the genius multi-instrumentalists behind the band Mr. This. In my spare time I work as a programmer. I'm not available for hire to other bands.

...but seriously folks, I'm the CTO and cofounder of [Correlated](https://www.getcorrelated.com), where we're building a revenue expansion platform for sales teams. We're doing a ton of interesting work in analytics, data systems, visualization, and data operationalization. Please get in touch if you're interested!
